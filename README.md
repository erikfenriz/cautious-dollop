## Weather Widget

Simple app, that show weather from external API; For access to API create .env file with REACT_APP_API_KEY constant

[Live Demo](https://nueq22.github.io/react-weather-app/)

## This is a completed test task:

- Application should provide 7-day (or less if there any API restrictions) forecast starting from
  today;
- City can be selected by name or current geo-coordinates can be used;
- In the list temperature should be shown for a daytime, icons should be neutral;
- In the section "Current weather" the temperature and icon depend on the current time;
- According to changes in control "Scale's type" (C or F) convert temperature from Celsius to
  Fahrenheit or vice versa;
- If page was reloaded then application should restore state (if any city was selected by name or
  coordinates, it should be shown saved forecast, but in background, app should ask about new
  data);
- Make it responsive (suggest your option for mobile)
- The result should be available in a Git repository (on Github or Bitbucket for example)
- We don't have strong requirements about JS frameworks, but we're using React in our project,
  would be nice to use it for test assignment;
- CSS frameworks shouldn't be used for this test assignment. Preferably use a CSS
  preprocessor (Stylus, Sass, etc...)
- It should work as single page application. Although this specific task can be done in a more
  simple way, it is important that you use some package manager and other tools (like task runners
  or JS transpilers and CSS preprocessors)
